    <h1><a href="wraf.html">Wraf</a>: Exceptions</h1>

    <p><em>Exceptions</em> are a way to implement the response to
      unexpected answers in a <a href="session.html">session</a>.</p>

    <p>A <a href="request.html">request</a> comes with an expected
      type of answer.  Usually the expectations include the number of
      returned resources in the <a href="selection.html"
      >selection</a>.</p>  

    <p>An exception can be seen as a request for more information.
      You could for example request the phone number of a person with
      a certain name.  The <a href="service.html">service</a> finds
      two person with the specified name and tells you to choose
      whictch one you mean by throwing an exception.  The exception
      will be picked up by one of the calling <a href="context.html"
      >contexts</a>.  The context can answer by adding the extra
      information.  If the information can't be found in the context,
      a response will be <a href="presentation.html">presented</a> for
      the <a href="agent.html">agent</a>, requesting the additional <a
      href="criterion.html">criterion</a>.</p>
