    <h1><a href="wraf.html">Wraf</a>: Jumptables</h1>

    <p>Every <a href="interface.html">Interface</a> has a hash tree
      that says, for each <a href="namespace.html">namespace</a> and
      type, what methods it support.</p>

    <p>Each <a href="node.html">node</a> has a customized jumptable selectd from a
      jumpjumptable of jumptables.  The jumptable connects each method
      name with a list of subroutine reference collected from the
      connected interfaces.  The key used in the selection of a jumptable
      consists of three parts:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>A orderd list of connected interfaces; <a href="ids.html">the IDS</a></li>
      <li>A orderd list of domain prefixes</li>
      <li>A orderd list of types</li>
    </ol>

    <p>A jumptable that doesn't exist gets created on demand.  Nodes not
      used for method calls never needs a jumptable.</p>



    <h2>Circular dependencies</h2>

    <p>The jumptable depends on the list of types. But in order to
      determine the list of types for a specific Resource, you have to
      call <code>init_types()</code>, which will be called from the
      jumptable.  This situation is resolved by temporary setting the
      Resource type list to <code>RDFS:Resouce</code>.  A temporary
      jumptable gets created and init_types gets called.  The
      jumptable will at least know which interfaces that handles the
      specific resource, based on its URI.  The
      <code>init_types()</code> must be located in the
      <code>RDFS:Resouce section</code>.  After the types has been
      initiated, the original call will be dispatched.</p>
    
    <p>The internal method <code>declare_add_types()</code> (that is
      called by the interfaces implementations of
      <code>init_types()</code>) will need to call
      <code>init_props()</code> (that initialize all the nodes
      properties) for each class in order to find
      <code>subClassOf</code> properties.  That will lead to infinite
      recursions for some top classes.  <code>RDFS:Resource</code>
      never gets a chanse to define it's types since
      <code>init_types()</code> calls <code>init_props()</code> for
      itself.  this has been resolved by skipping the
      <code>subClassOf</code> calls for <code>RDFS:Literal</code>,
      <code>RDFS:Resource</code> and <code>RDF:Statement</code>; ie
      all the types of nodes that are created by the
      <code>init_props()</code> process.  (I not yet fully understands
      what happens here.)</p>

<hr />


All context/client-dependent functions should use the session
object methods or send it in as a parameter. This construction
is a compromise to shorten the method calls in most cases, so
that we doesn't have to tag along the context varaible evrywhere
and so that we still can reuse the cached resource objects
between more than one session.
