    <h1><a href="wraf.html">Wraf</a>: Scenarios</h1>

    <p>Wraf uses <a href="caching.html">caching</a> in order to speed
      up the system.  The second time Wraf gets the same <a href=
      "request.html" >request</a>, it will use the cached answer.</p>

    <p>In order to find the answer, Wraf may have to retrieve data
      from other <a href="service.html">services</a> on the internet,
      and make many searches and <a href="inference.html"
      >inferences</a>.  This can take a long time.</p>

    <p><em>Scenarios</em> can be used to find the answers to a
      question before anyone has asked it.  This will lead to the
      answers being cached before the first request, making the system
      respond faster.</p>

    <p>Free time and resources will be used for developing those
      scenarios.  The scenarios will be choosen on a) how likely they
      are, b) how time consuming they are, and c) how important
      they are.</p>

    <p>As an example; if the system know you have an intrest in Perl,
    it can spend its free time searching the web for news about Perl.
    The next time you ask about Perl news, it will have a presentation
    ready for you.</p>

    <p>Since everyone is free to state anything, Wraf can have a
      scenario there it states things that it know is not true but
      want to explore.  It just set up the scenario to trust
      hypothetical statings and pursue the questions.</p>

    <p>Not implemented</p>
