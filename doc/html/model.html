    <h1><a href="wraf.html">Wraf</a>: Model</h1>

    <p>A <em>Model</em> is a <a href="container.html">container</a> of
      statements from a specific source.  A typical model is a
      document consisting of RDF serialized as XML.  The URI of the
      resource representing the model should be a part of a namespace
      controlled by the same entity as the one that created the
      model.</p>

    <p>We should consider the diffrent parts involved:</p>

    <ol>

      <li>The model URI</li>

      <li>The URL of the remote location</li>

      <li>The local copy of the model</li>

      <li>The entity owning model URI namespace</li>

      <li>The entity owning the URL namespace</li>

      <li>The <a href="agent.html">agent</a> of the model</li>

    </ol>

    <p>Let's say that a <a href="service.html">service</a> has
      imported a model to be presented for a requestor.  This means
      that the service says that the remote location owner says that
      the model owner says that the agent says that each of the
      statements in the model is <a href="truth.html">true</a>.  The
      agent is the primary <a href="stater.html">stater</a>.</p>

    <p>A model can either be open or closed.  An open model can be
      modified by the owner.  A closed model will never change.  An
      remote open model will have a expiration date after which time
      the source should be checked for a new version.</p>

    <p>There can be several diffrent versions of the same model but
      only one should be regarded as the correct one.  The model
      metadata states if the model is open or closed, the time it was
      created, the agent and other things.  The service have to
      decide who and what to trust for giving this metadata.</p>

    <p>A <a href="session.html">session</a> is a model that closes
      then the session ends.</p>

    <p>Every <a href="node.html">node</a> represents a <a href=
      "stating.html">stating</a>.  The resource represented by the
      node has a property <code>ls:model</code> stating which model
      contains the statements contained in the node.</p>

    <p>A model is a <code>rdfs:subClassOf rdfs:Container</code>.
      Every member of the container is a
      <code>rdf:Statement</code>.</p>

    <p>A document with serialized RDF in XML can <a href=
      "citation.html">cite</a> statements and include <a href=
      "literal.html">Literals</a>.</p>
