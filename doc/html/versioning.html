    <h1><a href="wraf.html">Wraf</a>: Versioning</h1>

    <p><em>Versioning</em> will be implemented as <a href=
      "views.html">views</a>.</p>


    <p>We want to get statements that are 1) correct and 2) current.
      A statement (or all statements in a <a href="model.html"
      >model</a>) can be withdrawn.</p>

    <p>A statement can be withdrawn because it has allways been
      false.  See <a href="truth.html">truth</a>.</p>

    <p>The second type of versioning says that some statement is true
      during a specific time period.  So let us specify that we want
      to know the properties of a thing, as it was in
      1999. <code>$thing->arc( valid_during => $date_range
      )->list</code>.  All this is dependent on that we decide on how
      to describe dates, and more.  The <em>valid_during</em> talks
      about the arc and not the object.  The valid_during can be
      dynamicly <a href="inference.html">infered</a> from other
      properties; for example from the model.</p>

    <p>Not implemented</p>
