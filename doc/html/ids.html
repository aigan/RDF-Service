    <h1><a href="wraf.html">Wraf</a>: IDS</h1>

    <p><em>IDS</em> stands for <em><strong>I</strong>nterface
	<strong>D</strong>omain <strong>S</strong>ignature</em>.</p>

    <p>Every <a href="session.html">session</a> connects to one or
      more <a href="interface.html">interfaces</a>.  Those interfaces
      defines the known universe.

    <p>The <a href="node.html">node</a> holding the session resource
      will hold a orderd list of connected <a href= "interface.html"
      >interfaces</a>.  The signature, called <em>IDS</em> will be
      generated from this order.</p>

    <p>Every node will be marked with a IDS.  The node will be <a
      href="caching.html">cached</a> and can be used again if a node
      with the same signature is fetching the same resource.</p>

    <p>This means that all the node methods is only dependent on the
      order of the connected interfaces.  This also means that for
      each resource there can be one node for each IDS.  They are the
      same resource, but viewed within diffrent universes, they appear
      diffrent in regard to the result of queries, etc.</p>

    <p>This construction is based on the asumption that there will be
      many <a href="agent.html">agents</a> using the same
      signature. That is: the same node will be reused more times than
      not.</p>

    <p>The objects signature is a read only value.</p>

    <p>Presently, the individual session and base_model resources is
      morphed to the new IDS upon connection to a new interface.  This
      should probably change.</p>
