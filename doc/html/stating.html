      Wraf: Stating

    <h1><a href="wraf.html">Wraf</a>: Stating</h1>

    <p>A <em>stating</em> is a statement existing in a <a href=
      "model.html" >model</a>.</p>

    <p>The M&S (Ch 6) says:</p>

    <blockquote>The <code>Description</code> element itself represents
      an instance of a Bag resource. The members of this Bag are the
      resources corresponding to the reification of each of the
      statements in the <code>Description</code>. If the
      <code>bagID</code> attribute is specified its value is the
      identifier of this Bag, else the Bag is anonymous.</blockquote>

    <p>A document with RDF serialized as XML will have its statements
      represented as statings in the corresponding model.  The URI of
      the stating resource will be the same as the URI for the reified
      statement contained in the Description bag.</p>

    <h2>Normal <em>single</em> representation</h2>

    <p>The stating is represented in the system by a <a href=
      "node.html">node</a>.  The object has one node reference each
      for a subject (SUBJ), predicate (PRED) and object (OBJ).  These
      three slots represents the implicit statings that makes up a
      reified statement.  They can, in the rare cases its necessary,
      be refered to by the <a href="aliases.html">aliasing</a>
      functionality.</p>

    <p>The model of the stating is stored in the MODEL slot of the
      node.  The same slot is used for the model of the implicit
      statings.  But the implicit statings are <a href=
      "inference.html" >infered</a> from the model, and does actually
      not belong to the model.  I have not yet decided on how this
      distinction will be handled.</p>

    <h2>MULTI representation</h2>

    <p>Two models can contain the same statement.  The URI of the
      resource corresponding to the reification of the statement will
      in most cases be unique.  URIs generated for anonymous resources
      is guaranteed to be unique.</p>  

    <p>If a URI, not within the model namespace, is explicitly given
      to a statement by the model, it will be interpreted by Wraf as
      refereing to a specific stating.  In this case, it is possible
      that two models talks about the same stating but gives them
      diffrent properties.  They may not give the statement resource
      the same predicate, subject and object.</p>

    <p>Wraf expects every stating to exist in exactly one model.  Wraf
      will treat statings with the same URI existing in more than one
      model as a special case.  A normal stating will internally be
      represented in the system as a <a href="node.html">node</a>.  In
      the special case, each implicit stating will be made
      explicit.</p>
