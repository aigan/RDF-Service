    <h1><a href="wraf.html">Wraf</a>: Caching</h1>

    <p>The system will use intelligent caching and optimizations in
      order to gain in speed without sacrifice any flexibility.  A
      persistant backend <a href="service.html">service</a> deamon
      will take requests from <a href="client.html">clients</a>.</p>

    <p>The cache will primarly consist of <a
      href="node.html">nodes</a>.  More data will be contained inside
      each node.</p>  


    <h2>Primary data</h2>

    <p>The primary data consists of the original information about
      triples, types, models, and literals.  It can't be recreated if
      lost.  The statement, types and models data is bidirectional.
      The objects points at its classes and the classes point at its
      objects.  Wee keep information on whether the data has been
      stored yet or if it doesn't have to be stored.</p>

    <h2>Secondary data</h2>

    <p>The secondary data is infered from primary data and can be
      recreated if lost.  It is primarly cached <a href=
      "selection.html" >selections</a> from <a href="request.html"
      >requests</a>.</p>

    <p>A callback will be registred in each resource (or some grouping
      thereof) used for generating the result.  A change in a source
      resource will exprire the selection.  If the source data can't
      be made to expire the selection, normal expiration dates could
      be used.</p>

    <p>Cached data will have some matadata used to expire the least
      needed data in order to save memory.</p>

    <p>The key to the selection consists of it's <a href=
      "criterion.html">criterions</a>.  This include the <a href=
      "context.html" >context</a>.  Only the used criterions should be
      part of the key.  The <a href="agent.html">agent</a> is part of
      the context, but should not be part of the key, since the cached
      selection should be used by other agents with similar <a href=
      "preference.html">preferences</a>.</p>


    <p>Only primary data are implemented yet.</p>
