    <h1><a href="wraf.html">Wraf</a>: Views</h1>

    <p>A <em>view</em> is the result of a <a href="request.html"
      >request</a> in a <a href="context.html">context</a>.  The view
      kan be formatted as a RDF response, or in HTML, depending on the
      <a href="presentation.html">presentation</a> layer used.</p>

    <p>A view can be of a resource with its properties.  Diffrent
      types of views could be a combination from:</p>

    <ol>

      <li>A specific <a href="versioning.html">version</a></li>

      <li>Only <a href="trust.html">trusted</a> data</li>

      <li>The property values at a specific time</li>

      <li>values according to a specific perspective</li>

      <li>A specified language</li>

      <li>Only high quality data</li>

      <li>Only data from or about a specific group</li>

    </ol>

    <p>And it should work well with diffrent types of statemets (or
      groups of statements) that is suppoesed to override previous
      ones.</p>

    <h2>Unknown properties versus known negatives</h2>

    <p>If the metadata about a person doesn't include a phone number,
      does that mean that the person doesn't have a phone or does it
      mean that the source doesn't know the phone number for the
      person?</p>

    <p>We have two options:</p>

    <ol>

      <li>Explicitly state that a specific statement is false, or that
	a resoruce doesn't have a specific property (ie, has zero true
	statements with a specific predicate).</li>

      <li>Put metadata, in the model or interface, explaining what
	properties it knows about specified types of resoruces.  For
	example, it can state that it knows about all names and phone
	numbers for the persons it has data about.  This should be
	specified by giving the resource a property pointing to a
	template specifying these implicit negative properties.</li>

    </ol>
