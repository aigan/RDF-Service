    <h1><a href="wraf.html">Wraf</a>: Citation</h1>

    <p>Each statement in a <a href="model.html">model</a> has a
      corresponding resource representing the reified statement.
      These are the statements regarded as facts by the model <a
      href="agent.html">agent</a>.  A <em>spelled out</em> reified
      statement is not regarded as a fact, and is called a
      <em>citation</em>.</p>

    <p>Citations are <a href="stating.html">statings</a>, even if the
      model or agent of the stating is unknown.</p>  

    <p>If the URI of the stating is specified, it could be the URI of
      a resource actually stated in another model.  In this case, the
      origin is known and the properties of the stating (the
      predicate, subject, object, etc) could be left out.</p>

    <p>In the common case, the original URI of the stating cited is
      unknown.  In this case, the stating will be placed in a special
      model created only for citations contained in the specific
      model.</p>

    <p>The cited stating can be traced back to the model in which it
      was cited by the four reification statings that
      <strong>do</strong> belong to that model.  We may avoid creating
      a separate <a href="node.html">node</a> for each of the four
      statings of the reification, in order to save space.  The origin
      of the citation could be known by metadata for the special
      citation model.  The model could have a <code>quotedIn</code>
      property.  A FACT slot (for the node) will <strong>not</strong>
      be used.</p>

    <p>A citation could, instead or in addition to the correct stating
      URI, include enough data to <a href="inference.html">infere</a>
      which stating is cited.  This could for example be done by
      adding the <code>ls:model</code> property.  The citation can
      then be coupled to the original stating by use of <a href=
      "aliases.html">aliasing</a>.  The alias statement will be placed
      in a model according to the inference.</p>
