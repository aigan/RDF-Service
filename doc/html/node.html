      Wraf: Node

    <h1><a href="wraf.html">Wraf</a>: Node</h1>

    <p>A <em>node</em> is a Perl object of the class
    <code>RDF::Service::Resource</code>.  It is the internal (to the
    system) representation of one or more <a href="stating.html"
    >statings</a>.  This includes nodes that represent <a href=
    "literal.html">literals</a>.</p>

    <p>Every node represent a resource with a known URI.
      <em>Anonymous resources</em> will be given a URI in the local
      namespace.</p>

    <p>There are two ways of representing statings in Wraf.  Explicit
      statings is represented by nodes with <code>RDF:Statement</code>
      properties.  Implicit statings is stored <em>inside</em> the
      node.  See how <a href="stating.html">statings</a> and <a href=
      "literal.html">literals</a> are represented as nodes.</p>

    <p>There are three reasons for having implicit statings:</p>

    <ol>

      <li>Save space</li>

      <li>Save time</li>

      <li>Most important:  It lets us treat every stating in the
	system as a resource, but avoids infinite recursion.</li>

    </ol>

    <h2>Node slots</h2>

    <p>Each node has a number of slots (properties of the object) that
      can be handled as implicit statings.  These implicit statings
      will either have a literal or another resource as the object.
      The literal type uses a scalar reference in the slot.  The
      nonliteral type uses a reference to another node.  Most of these
      can be undefined.</p>

    <p>The MODEL slot is for statement resoruces and for the implicit
      statings determined by the LABEL and VALUE slot.  Some of the
      other implicit statings are a sort of adaption and should be
      seen as infered statings.  Not clear on how to handle this.</p> 

    <h2>Other things</h2>

    <p>All data is taged with information about wheter it has been
      saved into an <a href="interface.html">interface</a> or not.
      The storage can be prosponded and done then Wraf has
      nothing better to do.</p>
