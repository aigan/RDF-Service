      Wraf: Reasoning

    <h1><a href="wraf.html">Wraf</a>: Reasoning</h1>

    <p>Wraf should be self aware of its reasoning, during it's
      reasoning process, in order to choose tactics (the path) to get
      an answer and to change path during the process.</p>

    <p>Circular reasoning is detected and avoided.</p> 

    <p>Wraf has a certain amount of patience.  It will give up if it
      has to do too much work to get an answer.  Every <a
      href="request.html">request</a> is coupled with some type of
      expected response.  For example, a person is only expected to
      have one date of birth.  If one answer is found on the question
      of date of birth, we can stop searching for more answers.  There
      may be another answer somewhere.  The <a href="context.html"
      >context</a> will have to contain implicit information on
      whether it's ok to return the first best answer, or if we should
      search everything (we can find).</p>
