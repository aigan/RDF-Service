      Wraf: Session

    <h1><a href="wraf.html">Wraf</a>: Session</h1>

    <p>A <em>session</em> can be pictured as a discussion between the
      <a href="service.html">service</a> and the <a href="agent.html"
      >agent</a>, via the <a href="client.html">client</a>.  They both
      send information to each other.  It will typically be the agent
      that <a href="request.html">request</a> information from the
      service.</p>

    <p>The <a href="node.html">node</a> representing the session is
      called <code>ls:Service</code> and is a <code>rdfs:subClassOf <a
      href="model.html" >ls:Model</a></code>.</p>

    <p>The answer to requests depend on which <a href="interface.html"
      >interfaces</a> the session has connected to.</p>

    <p>A new session object starts by connecting to the Base
      interface.  It will then (usually) connect to <a href=
      "interface/dbi.html">the DBI interface</a>, used to store new
      statings.  This means that the session metadata (mainly the
      creation time of the model) will be created in a IDS without
      the ability to store the data.</p>

    <p>Wraf will keep track on all data belonging to the session and
      copy all unsaved data to the new IDS then the session connects
      to a new interface.</p>

    <p>A future data addition followed by a storage will store all
      unsaved referenced data.  This will save the session metadata
      the instance it is referenced by anything else.  This also makes
      it possible to defere the database work until after the response
      has been sent to the client.</p>


    <p>The plan is to keep the diffrent IDS caches syncronized was to
      make changes in one IDS expire the related items in the other
      IDS and let the updated value come from the appropriate
      interface.</p>
