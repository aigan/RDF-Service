    <h1><a href="wraf.html">Wraf</a>: Trust</h1>

    <p>The <a href="versioning.html">versioning</a> system and the
      <em>trust</em> system are two aspects of the same thing.  To
      trust or not to trust is just one <a
      href="views.html">view</a>.</p>

    <p>Usually, we only want trusted data. Other times, we want to see
      all data and decide for ourself. We could then just get all data
      and order on trust.  We can also specify a orderd list of
      prefered sources. (As with the desired language.)  </p>

    <p>The details of inherited trust will be detailed later, building
      on a system of <a href="inference.html">inferencing</a>.</p>

    <p>For now, we just look at the <a href="agent.html">agent</a>
      behind a <a href="model.html">model</a> containing a <a
      href="stating.html" >stating</a>.  We could check it against the
      list of trusted agents by saying <code>$node->arc( model => {
      agent => [ $agent1, $agent2, $agent3 ] } )</code>.</p>

    <p>But the default <a href="preference.html">preference</a> will
      be to only get <a herf="truth.html">true</a> statements, and
      that will imply that they are trusted and <a href=
      "versioning.html" >current</a>.  The handling of trust must be
      efficient even with a large amount of trusted sources.  Let's
      say we have a third party service saying what models, agents or
      namespaces we can trust.  This would be done by a <a
      href="interface.html">interface</a> defining the trust()
      method/property and could be used by saying <code>$node->arc(
      trusted => 1 )</code>.  That will call the trusted() method once
      for every arc of the <a href="node.html" >node</a>.  It's up to
      the interface implementing the method to do what it have to do
      to be fast.</p>

    <p>To trust a statement, all implicit <a
      href="stater.html">staters</a> has to be trusted.</p>

    <p>Not implemented</p>
