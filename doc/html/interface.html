    <h1><a href="wraf.html">Wraf</a>: Interface</h1>

    <p>Wraf uses interfaces to other sources in order to integrate all
      data in one enviroment, regardless of storage format.  You can
      read and update information from configuration files, databases,
      XML files, LDAP, etc.</p>

   <p>The <a href="service.html">service</a> collects information
      from diffrent sources through interfaces.  The answer to <a
      href="request.html">requests</a> depend on which interfaces the
      <a href="session.html">session</a> has connected to.</p>

    <p>Each combination of connected interfaces is given a unique key
      called IDS. Every IDS has it's own <a href="caching.html"
      >cache</a>.  The idea is that it in the common case will be many
      sessions using the same IDS cache.</p>

    <p>It's one thing to be the owner or home interface of a node, and
      antoher thing to say something about the node or with the
      node. If we want to know everything said about a thing, we will
      have to search all interfaces that could give a part of the
      answer. But if we only want to know whats said from a limited
      number or sources, we can restrict the search to the interfaces
      that handles the models owned by the source we are intrested in.
