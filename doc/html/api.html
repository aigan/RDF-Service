    <h1><a href="wraf.html">Wraf</a>: API</h1>

    <p>See the <a href="../tutorial.txt">tutorial</a> for an
      introduction on how to use <code>RDF::Service</code> for
      creating an RDF application.</p>

    <h2>Syntax summary</h2>

    <p>Predicates can be used in the place of <a href=
      "request.html">request</a> methods.  For a property to be used
      in this way, they have to be declared as the <a href=
      "abbrevation.html">abbrevation</a> of their full URI.</p>

    <p>Elements in <code>[]</code> are ORed together and pairs in
      <code>{}</code> are ANDed together.  The special props <code>and
      => [...]</code> and <code>or => {}</code> changes that
      behaviour.  <code>not => [...]</code> and <code>not =>
      {...}</code> negates the effect of <code>[]</code> and
      <code>{}</code>.</p>

    <p>The method attributes are called <a href=
      "criterion.html">criterions</a>, as they decide which resources
      should be included in the result <a href="selection.html"
      >selection</a>.</p>

    <p>The API is definately not finalized.  Some of these things
      doesn't make sense.  This mainly shows the intended style of the
      API.</p>


    <p>Return a <a href="selection.html">selection</a> of all arcs
      with $node as subj:</p>

    <blockquote><code>$node->arc()</code></blockquote>


    <p>Return a selection of all arcs with $node as subj and $pred as
      pred:</p>

    <blockquote><code>$node->arc($pred)</code></blockquote>


    <p>Return a selection of all arcs with $node as subj and one of
      $pred1, pred2 or $pred3 as pred:</p>

    <blockquote><code>$node->arc([$pred1, $pred2, $pred3])</code></blockquote>



    <p>Return a selection of all arcs with $node as subj, $pred as
      pred and that has a property with the key $x and value $y.  All
      the criterions must be matched. The 'pred' property are used as
      a short for the RDF:predicate property:</p>

    <blockquote><code>$node->arc({pred => $pred, $x => $y })</code></blockquote>



    <p>The property $x must have the value of *either* $y or $z:</p>

    <blockquote><code>$node->arc({ $x => [ $y, $z ] })</code></blockquote>



    <p>I hope that this is much more pover than actualy needed in
      practical use.  This would be the same as "for each arc that has
      node as subject, return all arcs for which the following is
      true; <code>( ( (P(a)==b) OR ( (P(c)==d) AND (P(e)==f) ) ) AND (
      (P(g)==h) ) )</code>:</p>

    <blockquote><code>$node->arc({and=>[[{$a=>$b},{$c=>$d,$e=>$f}],{$g=>$h}]})</code></blockquote>


    <p>Return all arcs that has a property $a those value is a
      resource that has the property $b with the value $c:</p>

    <blockquote><code>$node->arc({ $a => { $b => $c } })</code></blockquote>



    <p>The same, but create the selection as the union of the result
      from each nodes in the parent selection:</p>

    <blockquote><code>$selection->select_arc(...)</code></blockquote>



    <p>The same, but substitute the subj with the obj:</p>

    <blockquote><code>$selection->select_rev_arc(...)</code></blockquote>



    <p>Return object (and *not* a selection) (matching the criterions)
      of an arc:</p>

    <blockquote><code>$arc->obj(...)</code></blockquote>



    <p>Return all objects of all arcs that has $node as subj:</p>

    <blockquote><code>$node->arc_obj()</code></blockquote>



    <p>Return all objects that has a reverse arc with $pred as
      predicate and $node as subj.  That is the same as "all the
      values of the $node property $pred":

      <blockquote><code>$node->arc_obj( $pred )</code></blockquote>



    <p>Same as arc_obj, but substitute obj with subj:</p>

    <blockquote><code>$node->arc_subj( $pred )</code></blockquote>



    <p>Return the only match from a container (or selection), or <a
      href="exception.html">throw an exception</a>:</p>

    <blockquote><code>$container->li()</code></blockquote>



    <p>Return element 8 (counting from 1) in the container:</p>

    <blockquote><code>$container->li( 8 )</code></blockquote>



    <p>Return the only resource from a container matching the
      citerions, or throw an exception if there was many matches:</p>

    <blockquote><code>$container->li( ... )</code></blockquote>



    <p>Return a selection of containers (including models and
      selections) matching the specified criterions and including this
      $node:</p>

    <blockquote><code>$node->rev_li( ... )</code></blockquote>



    <p>The same as li() but returns a selection instead of a single
      resource:</p>

    <blockquote><code>$container->select( ... )</code></blockquote>



    <p>Return all objects of the arcs that has $node as subj and XXX
      as pred, matching the specified criterions.  XXX here is any
      predicate registred as an abbrevation:</p>

    <blockquote><code>$node->XXX( ... )</code></blockquote>



    <p>The same as XXX() but substitute subj with obj:</p>

    <blockquote><code>$node->rev_XXXX( ... )</code></blockquote>


    <p>Most of this is not implemented.  See <a href=
    "api/RDF/Service/Context.html">RDF::Service::Context</a> and <a
    href="../tutorial.txt">the tutorial</a> for the currently
    implemented methods.</p>
