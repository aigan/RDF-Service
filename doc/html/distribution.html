    <h1><a href="wraf.html">Wraf</a>: Distributed properties</h1>

    <p>A <em>distributed property</em> is a property that applies to
      many resources, but are stored internally as one <a href=
      "stating.html">stating</a>.</p>

    <p>A property can be distributed over a <a href=
      "container.html">container</a> (including <a href=
      "model.html">models</a>, <a href="interface.html">interfaces</a>
      and <a href="selection.html">selections</a>), a <a href=
      "namespace.html" >namespace</a>, or all resources of a specific
      type.</p>

    <p>A property can also be inversly distributed, in such a way that
      a resource gains all the properties that a group of resources
      has.  For example, a resource could have the aggregated
      properties of all the resources in a container.</p>

    <p>The existence of this distribution functionality was forced by
      the <code>aboutEachPrefix</code> syntax, and has been
      generalized to be as useful as possible.</p>  

    <p>A distributed property will act exactly as normal properties.
      But the statings will have implicit properties explaining the
      situation.  The diffrent types of distributions will also be
      modelled in a way that allowes the data to be exported in the
      compact, non-expanded version.</p>

    <p>Not implemented</p>
