    <h1>HDC - Hypertext Documentation Community</h1>

    <p>This will be a virtual community aimed at gathering,
      structuring and refining knowledge in a web of related
      topics.</p>

    <p>It will provide tools accumulating discussion entries and
      harvesting every useful sentence thereof.  The result will be a
      growing hypertext encyclopedia and guide to find the people you
      search for.</p>

    <p>It will have automated links to related topics, based on
      metadata.  <a href="wraf.html">Wraf</a> will be the tool used to
      create this website.</p>

    <p>I see a lot of suggestions on how to do things better (in
      information technology).  New concepts has sometimes led to
      applications meant to demonstrate the strength of the concept.
      This could be some type of information discovery system,
      document classification, reasoning engine, community
      infrastructure, or other things.  I believe that we must
      <strong>combine</strong> all those things in order to get the
      desired effect.  Each of them by themself is not enough.  We
      have to mix automatic classifications systems with collaborative
      filtering and normal classification systems.</p>


    <h2>Sites with similar types of functions</h2>

    <ul>

      <li><a href="http://www.everything2.net/" target="ext_example">Everything2</a></li>

      <li><a href="http://slashdot.org/" target="ext_example">Slashdot</a></li>

      <li><a href="http://www.imdb.com/" target="ext_example">IMDB</a></li>

      <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/" target="ext_example">Amazon</a></li>

      <li><a href="http://directory.google.com/" target="ext_example">ODP @ Google</a></li>
    
    </ul>

    <h2>Connecting nodes</h2>

    <p>Every page is a topic or an aspect of a topic.  Every page will
      have links to related topics.  The <a href="presentation.html"
      >presentation</a> will be adapted to the <a href=
      "preference.html" >preferences</a> of the <a href="agent.html"
      >agent</a>.</p>

    <p>The links would be grouped by things like</p>

    <ul>

      <li>community members intrested in this topic</li>

      <li>books about the topic</li>

      <li>movies about the topic</li>

      <li>articles about the topic</li>

      <li>Broader topics that include the topic</li>

      <li>Topics that go into detail about the topic</li>

      <li>Same topic in diffrent viewpoints</li>

      <li>Comments on the topic</li>

      <li>News on the topic</li>

      <li>Organisations intrested in the topic</li>

      <li>Upcoming events regarding the topic</li>

    </ul>

    <p>This for potential thousends of topics.</p>

    <p>All data would belong to diffrent classes, like member, book,
      news, comment, etc. Each class will expect diffrent data. A book
      could have data about its author ( that could be a single author
      or a bag of them ), the title, its publisher, etc. Many books
      will have a limited set of data. But some book pages will
      include things like "this book contains a foreword by that
      author".</p>

    <p>The point is that The data of the book should be dynamic. It
      should link to whatever comes up. And books is just one of many,
      many things. It could be a subclass to "media".</p>

    <p>A community member would be a subclass of a person. Persons
      could also be authors, or just someone referred from one or more
      topics.</p>

    <p>The web will grow by user contribution.</p>


    <p>I have manualy created a personal site (in swedish), containing
      nearly 1500 pages.</p>
