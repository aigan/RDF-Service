    <h1><a href="wraf.html">Wraf</a>: Context</h1>

    <p>The context is used as the base for a information <a href=
      "request.html">request</a>.  It's sot of part of the request.
      It contains your <a href="preference.html">preferences</a> used
      to select the wanted <a href= "views.html">view</a>.</p>

    <p>For the <a href="api.html"><code>RDF::Service</code> API</a>,
      every returned object is actually a Context object containing a
      <a href="node.html">node</a> object.  The context object holds
      the context for the node.  All methods in the API are actually
      context methods.</p>

    <p>The context holds infromation about the <a
      href="session.html">session</a>, and the <a href=
      "reasoning.html" >reasoning process</a> itself.  This includes a
      memory of what things already has been asked, in order to
      recognize thought loops.</p>

    <p>The context will complement the requests with implicit <a href=
      "criterion.html">criterions</a>.  These criterions will come
      from the context itself, the session and the <a href=
      "agent.html" >agent</a> behind the session.</p>

    <p>Statements in the current session context will have precedence
      over contradiciting statements in the general preference for the
      agent.  This will be handled using <a href="version.html"
      >versioning</a>, saying that the session statement replaces the
      other contradicting statements, but only for the current
      session.</p>

    <p>The <a href="trust.html">trust</a> model and the other things
      is part of the preferences in the context.</p>

    <p>Not implemented.  But we do use a context wrapper.</p>
