These are actually not a FAQ, but a NVFABVGQ - Not Very Frequently
Asked But Very Good Questions.


Q: Why should I use this?

A: There are a couple of other frameworks out there.  But I think Wraf
   is unique in how it does things.  It fully uses the flexibility of
   Perl.  The concepts takes RDF to another level, even beyond the
   Semantic Web.

   Present features includes the ability to work with mutlipple models
   and even multipple RDF sources at the same time.  Future features
   will include a type of logic system that just bypass the
   traditional complexities of inferencing.


Q: How do I parse RDF/XML files?

A: You don't.  That interface plugin has not been written yet.  The
   demo application adds RDF data via the HTML interface.
